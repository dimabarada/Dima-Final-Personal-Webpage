Abstract
This computer science report elaborates on the creation of my personal resume using LaTeX by overleaf,
and my own Portfolio website using coding languages. Also, they’re all found on my GitHub repository
after linking them using GitBash. Ill be explaining a brief overview on how I edited and enhanced my
templates, as well as going through a detail preview of the codes.
1 Introduction
Firstly, I created my resume on LaTeX by using template, it’s a very simple and organized . In addition to my
portfolio website, I was inspired by a few templates online and a lot of YouTube lessons, I gathered all the
information and created a portfolio then started editing it, now it looks very well designed and it has all the
sections I want to discuss on. However, a lot of changes and enhancements were done to both templates in
order to meet my expectations.
2 background
Hello my name is Dima Barada, I am currently a student in GISMA university of applied sciences, This
Computer lab report is to show my work and a discussion, The Portfolio Website linked with and the GitHub
repository. Throughout my journey, I have encountered various computer languages and many technical skills.
We have learned on how to write on Linux in order to open repositories, files, commands and many other stuff.
We learned on how to code on LaTex and create good-looking reports, resumes like this. We also learned
HTML and CSS to create efficient working websites.
3 Tools and technologies
The tools that were used were to create my website portfolio: HTML, CSS, JavaScript on VS-code. I used
a template which is linked in the end of this report. Here’s a brief explanation of the code. On HTML, 9
style-sheets were linked in order to have a very structured and designed view. Navigation bars, buttons and
content were created by opening a class. For each section, an ID was created, for later to edit it on CSS. The
website is a slide down page, with buttons to navigate to the specific sections ( about me, education, skills,
profile portfolio, contact) In GitHub, I opened a repository with 5 files ( assets, Final.html.code-workspace,
index.HTML, profile, readme.md) In the assets there are the CSS codes, images, downloads, fonts, JavaScript,
and logos. In order to open that repository, I copied my GitHub URL, then i navigated the repository by using
"cd", after that I cloned the repository on GitHub, so i added some files by using "git add." i commit changes
and then push on the terminal GitBash.
4 Design decisions
After I took this template, I had to eliminate some sections and replace some with my personal information
I made sure the theme is blue because its my favorite color. The website started with a background picture
of myself and a huge text highlighting my major, name, and a download CV button. Scrolling down to the
"about me section" which highlights my background and contact information. A picture of myself is shown
as well as my LinkedIn and Instagram account. In the education area, a horizontal timeline was added into
three parts. Basically in the class row, three columns were inserted. In the skills part, neon-blue progress
bars are added and each illustrates the percentage of personal knowledge Going down to the experience part,
its a vertical timeline showing the projects I have done and details like time and place. In the Portfolio part,
zoom in pictures demonstrating the Information technology I learned.Last but not least, the contact me part

containing personal contact information and a box for inquiry and messaging. For the CSS part which goes
through 9 sections, responsive web design is added so that if the website is opened with phone, tablet or
laptop it would be clearly shown. A jQuery plugin is used, ’The Owl Carouse ’in order to create active sliders
on the web page . CSS snipet such as Flaticon was used to show the logos and icons like LinkedIn, Instagram,
GitHub.Bootsnav framework is applied to style the navigation bar and make it functionable. Three animation
keyframes are put (bounce, flash, pulse). The style.css is to design all the colors, backgrounds, fonts, and size
of the information. Folder organization: in the assets folder it contains css, downloads, images, fonts, js, logo.
Javascript was used to adjust the navbars and hovers. In the index.html file it contains the basic structure
and backbone of the website, sections, and content.
5 Strengths and weaknesses
In this part I will be discussing the strengths and weaknesses of my website. For the strengths, The website
isn’t slow and its very smooth, its possible to slide down using the scroll function in the code or touch any
button and it navigates to the corresponding area. Another nice feature, is when scrolling down the hovering
words lights up depending on the section where we are located at.Overall, I’m satisfied with how the website
looks like, simple, interactive pictures, and nice colors. However, the weakness is in the profile section, where
the git hub logo was not showing, and other social media information are already put in other places so this
part is kind of empty. The other weakness is that the big background picture isn’t shown anywhere in the
code, so I had to replace the old picture with the new one for it to be changed. The website doesn’t have
any Hyperlinks about the personal information except the CV. When sending a message in the last part, the
submit button doesn’t function.I’m hoping in the future I fix these issues and create an enhanced portfolio.
6 Conclusion
Finally, throughout this experience of creating and editing a website I have learned many important and
interesting factors in Front-end development. I also got to know more about LaTeX and Linux which enlarged
my knowledge on the organization of files and data. I’m proud that I have come this far and already have put
my work on my GitHub repository, hopefully more projects to be posted in the future.
